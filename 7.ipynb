    "In an SQL query, the clauses are typically executed in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SELECT**: This clause specifies which columns you want to retrieve from the database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FROM**: This clause specifies the table(s) from which you are retrieving the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **JOIN**: If you are joining multiple tables, the JOIN clause specifies how the tables are related and how to combine their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **WHERE**: This clause filters the data based on specified conditions, restricting the rows that are included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **GROUP BY**: If you want to group the data for aggregate calculations, the GROUP BY clause is used. It specifies how the data should be grouped.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **HAVING**: If you want to filter the grouped data based on aggregate conditions, the HAVING clause is used. It acts similarly to the WHERE clause but operates on grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY**: This clause is used to sort the result set based on specified columns and sorting directions (ASC for ascending, DESC for descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT/OFFSET (Optional)**: Some databases support the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, which allow you to limit the number of rows returned and skip a specified number of rows, respectively.\n"
