    "Explanation of `cursor()` and `execute()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **cursor() Method**:\n",
    "   - The `cursor()` method is used to create a cursor object, which allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "   - The cursor acts as a control structure that enables you to interact with the database.\n",
    "   - It is created from the database connection and provides methods like `execute()`, `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, etc., for working with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **execute() Method**:\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries or statements.\n",
    "   - It takes an SQL query as an argument and sends it to the database for execution.\n",
    "   - The results of the executed query can be retrieved using methods like `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided example, we establish a connection to the MySQL database, create a cursor object using the `cursor()` method, and then execute a SELECT query using the `execute()` method. We fetch and print the results using the `fetchall()` method."
